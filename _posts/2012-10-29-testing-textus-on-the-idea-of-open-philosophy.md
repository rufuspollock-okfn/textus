Much of the discussion on open publication platforms within academia focuses on the accessibility issue from a very unique point of view: that of the actual ability to find and access publications/texts, as opposed to making the actual meaning and context in which these texts exist more ‘accessible’ to a wider audience. TEXTUS, a project supported by the Open Knowledge Foundation and Goldsmiths College, has tried to address both: first, by making philosophy texts already in the public domain more easily accessible, and second, by creating an environment where these texts can be read collectively online with readers benefiting from other readers’ notes, comments, questions and puzzles. This makes the reading experience much more accessible, less intimidating – particularly when you are talking about philosophy texts, and much more conducive to interaction and discussion.

While testing the [first BETA instance of TEXTUS](http://beta.openphilosophy.org/) with students and academics at Goldsmiths in the context of weekly reading groups, a number of issues became obvious:

1.  That the interactive features of the platform work best when the collectives using it are already clearly formed: either within the context of a reading group with a set membership, a classroom environment, or an interest group. A set collective allows for a creation of a trusted network whereby users will not be intimidated to make their comments visible and will, over time, interact better with each other: respond to each other’s annotations, etc.

2.  That the selection of texts to use is crucial: while a general interest in philosophy is important, a personal interest in the actual texts and authors chosen is even more important. The platform could thus work best in environments where this personal interest is either related to direct academic work users are doing, whether in the context of a course or in the context of a research project, such as a thesis or dissertation.

3.  That reading takes time: moving too quickly from one text to the next can be problematic, leading to rushed reading and less focus on going back over the text with other annotations in mind. Hence, selecting shorter texts for weekly reading, or longer texts for bi-weekly or monthly reading, would be more appropriate.

4.  That there is still a deep bias against online reading within academic communities: while newer generations of students are definitely moving towards online reading, older academics are finding it difficult to separate themselves from paper texts and handwritten annotations. Fears over loosing one’s annotations or being able to access the text at any point in time, will continue to keep many away from using such platforms.

5.  That the platform is most likely to survive if enough people adopt it: while the platform was designed to be open to all kinds of users, academic or not, TEXTUS stands its best chances to survive if integrated into the daily routine of those most likely to use it: either through integration with library online resources, integration into virtual learning environments systems, or integration into platforms such as academia.edu.

The Open Knowledge Foundation and Goldsmiths will continue to promote TEXTUS within their own networks, but if you are interested in learning more about this and the difference such a platform can make to you personally or to your institution, please feel free to [contact us](http://textusproject.org/contact/).
